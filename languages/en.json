        "title": "about me",
        "description": "Hi, my name is Roman Alvarez and I am a self-taught Front End Developer based in Argentina, Rosario. My first interactions with code began on my last grade of High School (2020), programming microcontrollers with Arduino, which I didn't like very much but made me curious about coding. In 2021 I decided to study Systems Engineering at the National Technological University (UTN), where I acquired knowledge of algorithms, structure programing and Python. Then in 2022 I started a FullStack bootcamp in RollingCode School, where I learned technologies such as Html, Css, Javascript, Sass, Figma, web design and also how to work with agile methodologies like Scrum. It wasn't easy to keep up to date with both careers but this taught me how to manage my times based on my objectives. Finally, in 2023 I switched to the Systems Analyst's career in the Higher Polytechnic Institute of Rosario. Nowadays, I'm studying my degree and learning web programing by myself in order to get my first job opportunity in the IT World."

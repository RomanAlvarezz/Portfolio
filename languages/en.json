        "description":"Hi, my name is Roman Alvarez and I am a self-taught Front End Developer based in Argentina. My first interactions with code began on sixth grade of High School (2020), programming microcontrollers with Arduino but I discovered my truly passion for programming last year when I decided to study systems engineering at the National Technological University (UTN) and also give it a try to the bootcamp of Rollingcode. It wasn't easy to keep up to date with both carrers but I learned a lot of stuff such as algorithms and data  structures, logical programming, working in teams with the scurm method and web design. I'm constantly trying to learn new technologies and concepts. I enjoy working with Javascript and I'm currently looking for my first job oportunity as a web developer.",
